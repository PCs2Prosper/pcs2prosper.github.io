										<h3>Donate Computers</h3>
										<div>
										We work primarily with corporations and small businesses looking to donate retired or out of warranty computers and peripherals like keyboards and mice. The computers should be in good working condition, preferably not more than three years old.. We accept desktops, laptops, monitors, keyboards, mice, hard disks, printers and other accessories.

    Tax Deductible:
    We are an IRS approved 503(c) charity and hence appropriate value of the computers you donate may be tax deductible.
    No Shipping! We come to your door for pickup:
    We will come to your door to pick up the computers and peripherals.
    No liabilities and messy support needs:
    While we would like computers cleared of any sensitive data, we understand that sometimes that is difficult to accomplish. We strive to fully clean the hard disk before the computer is placed and are willing to sign necessary papers releasing you of liability..

Pcs2Prosper is a non-profit charity striving to donate used computers and peripherals to economically disadvantaged and community serving bodies. Acquire just retired business computers and donate these for the betterment of the US citizens who can't afford a computer and improve their prosperity.

US IRS has classified Pcs2Prosper as a 501(c)(3) eligible tax-exempt organization. Hence all your donations are eligible for tax deductions.
 What does Pcs2Prosper do?
Pcs2Prosper is a non-profit charity striving to donate used computers and peripherals, like printers and monitors, to economically disadvantaged families and community-serving bodies. These include, but are not limited to: deserving individuals, public schools, libraries, and philanthropic organizations. Through the systematic collection of computer hardware from donor corporations and individuals, PCs2Prosper will service and then distribute PCs.


What kind of donations can I make?

How much of my donation goes to the recipient?
100% of your donation goes to the recipient. Our volunteers and board of directors do not accept any monetary compensation for their time.


How do I send my donations?
At this time, we are equipped to accept computer donations only from Collin and Travis counties, Texas. We will work with you to arrange a time and date for one of our volunteers to pick up donated items from your doorstep at no cost to you. Checks can be mailed to our business address.


What happens to the computes that I donate?
Every desktop or laptop donated to us will be inspected by our volunteers, who then will install a fresh copy of an operating system and word processing software. These laptops/desktops will then be matched to a needy recipient/organization.


What about my personal data on the computers that I donate?
While PCs2Prosper does install a fresh copy of the operating system, we are not responsible for left-over data on the donated computers. If you have sensitive data, we request that you first remove it and/or the operating system before making the donation.


Will I get a receipt?
Yes. We will provide you or your organization with a receipt detailing the description of the item along with the donation date and our tax ID number. However, for computer donations, be aware that we do not include the fair market value. It is up to the donor to determine the value of the donated items. If you make a monetary donation, we will declare the amount of the donation.
